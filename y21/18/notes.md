So what we have here is a case of what happens with too much time to think and getting stuck so far down one trail through the woods you can't see the road just a few feet away. I was busy having an actual life on a Friday night (imagine that!) so I had over an hour on public trasit between when I read the problem and when I could start coding. Which led to this. Another one I'm really not sure if I should be proud or horrified by what I've done. I actually think I like it. And explode() worked perfectly the first time I ran it, so I can't even say it was a nightmare to write or anything. It *would* be a nightmare to maintain - some of the least readble code I've ever written. Good thing no one has to do that!
