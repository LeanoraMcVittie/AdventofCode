My Advent of Code repo

I am doing this for fun. Sometimes the code is terrible, sometimes it's hilarious, sometimes I'm actually quite proud of it. But I (almost) always had fun writing it

I am not fast enough to make it onto any leaderboards, nor do I care to be, but I can typically knock out both parts in under an hour

2021 is my first year competing in real-time, but I'm also going back and doing some of the older challenges. The IntCode stuff in 2019 is a blast so far!

For Leanora in the future, you run a day with:
python3 main.py <year> <day> <part> <OPTIONAL: t to only run test, m to only run main, default both>
TODO: convert to click

Nothing else to add, really.
