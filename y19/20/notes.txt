I changed the input so that the ordering of the portals didn't matter
In the input I was given, there were portals NO and ON - I didn't want
to deal with ordering issues so I altered the input to change the ON 
portals to XN portals

I also changed the input so that for part2 I'd have an easier time
identifying inside and outside portals with 'i' and 'o' indicators
next to the portals. This seemed faster and easier and less annoying
than trying to determine which were which programatically based on cell
coordinates or whatever

Is altering the input "cheating"? Not in my opinion, but yours may differ

Overall I really enjoyed this one
